        <h1>Graphic Design</h1>
       <p>Graphic design is the process of visual communication and problem-solving through
the use of typography, photography and illustration. The field is considered a subset of
visual communication and communication design, but sometimes the term "graphic
design" is used synonymously. Graphic designers create and combine symbols,
images and text to form visual representations of ideas and messages. They use
typography, visual arts, and page layout techniques to create visual compositions.
Common uses of graphic design include corporate design (logos and branding),
editorial design (magazines, newspapers and books), advertising, web design,
communication design, product packaging and signage.</p>

      <h2>Branding is strategic. Marketing is tactical.</h2>
        <p2>http://www.tronviggroup.com/the-difference-between-marketing-and-branding/</p2>
        <p>Marketing may contribute to a brand, but the brand is bigger than any particular marketing effort. The brand is what remains after the marketing has swept through the room. It’s what sticks in your mind associated with a product, service, or organization—whether or not, at that particular moment, you bought or did not buy. The brand is ultimately what determines if you will become a loyal customer or not. The marketing may convince you to buy a particular Toyota, and maybe it’s the first foreign car you ever owned, but it is the brand that will determine if you will only buy Toyotas for the rest of your life. The brand is built from many things. Very important among these things is the lived experience of the brand. Did that car deliver on its brand promise of reliability? Did the maker continue to uphold the quality standards that made them what they are? Did the sales guy or the service center mechanic know what they were talking about? Marketing unearths and activates buyers. Branding makes loyal customers,advocates, even evangelists, out of those who buy. This works the same way for all types of businesses and organizations. All organizations must sell (including nonprofits). How they sell may differ, and everyone in an organization is, with their every action, either constructing or deconstructing the brand. Every thought, every action, every policy, every ad, every marketing promotion has the effect of either inspiring or deterring brand loyalty in whomever is exposed to it. All of this affects sales. Back to our financial expert. Is marketing a cost center? Poorly researched and executed marketing activities can certainly be a cost center, but well-researched and well-executed marketing is an investment that pays for itself in sales and brand reinforcement.Is branding a cost center? On the surface, yes, but the return is loyalty. The return issales people whose jobs are easier and more effective, employees who stay longer and work harder, customers who become ambassadors and advocates for the organization.
Branding is as vital to the success of a business or nonprofit as having financial
coherence, having a vision for the future, or having quality employees.
It is the essential foundation for a successful operation. So yes, it’s a cost center, like
good employees, financial experts, and business or organizational innovators are. They
are cost centers, but what is REALLY costly is not to have them, or to have substandard
ones.</p>

      <h1>Video</h1>
      <p>Videos are undoubtably the most viewed and shared content medium throughout all of today’s social media. Online video advertising is emerging as a powerful platform to deliver an impactful, immersive and highly targeted message. Every Brand, Business and Product needs at least one basic, informational video explaining what they do, who they are and exactly what they are all about to be successful with their Social Marketing. Your initial video needs to be a good representation of your brand. It also needs to be interesting enough to be viewed, liked and shared across the internet through your brand’s pages and by others. Design Pros can get your brand set up corrrectly and started in the right direction by building a professional online brand video presence. It doesn’t take a Hollywood production and budget to make an interesting video explaining your business or brand. We can use a combination of animated graphics, HD video options and photography to develop a professionally edited brand message that resonates with your fans and the chosen target markets across the World Wide Web. We can capture footage for you or you can provide your own content in order to get your message across and produced in a proper manor.</p>
